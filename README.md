## What is Burning Wheel?

Burning Wheel is an award-winning fantasy roleplaying game in which players take on the roles of vibrant, dynamic characters whose very beliefs propel the story forward. Starting with a simple D6 dice pool mechanic, this game intuitively builds on its core concepts. The rules detail dramatic systems for task resolution, advancement, trials of belief, tests of nerve, searing social conflict, dangerous sorcery, miraculous faith, and brutal, gut-wrenching martial combat.

## Why the Burning Wheel CharSheet?

For all but the simplest role playing games, tracking changes to characters is usually something between a headache and a chore! The complexity and character-driven nature of Burning Wheel makes it all the more difficult, and can often lead to critical minutes of game time lost to paging through the books looking up rules about how the current situation and the character's circumstances affect their next role. The Burning Wheel CharSheet is an attempt to automate and integrate those calculations, while displaying all of their critical information in an intuitive and powerful way.

The Burning Wheel Charsheet utilizes a clean, modern interface using MUI components and reactive styling to provide a seamless mobile-first experience. This is built using the MERN stack: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> and <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/">Node</a>, and is hosted on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/what" target="_blank">Heroku</a>.
